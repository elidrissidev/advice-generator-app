## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was an exciting challenge, I was able to use `react-query` for the first time to fetch the advice from the API and cache it, as well as handle the loading state. This is also the first time I test my work properly by insuring I mock the neccessary parts, like API endpoints.

### Continued development

Testing, testing, and testing. Yeah, I need to get better at it. It was also a bit difficult to handle error state for refetches in `react-query`, so I'd like to understand that more in the future.
